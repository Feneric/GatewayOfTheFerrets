The Gateway of the Ferrets
==========================

*Escape a dead end with the help of friendly ferrets*


What Is It?
-----------

The Gateway of the Ferrets is an interactive fiction game that can be played
online or downloaded via either `The Gateway of the Ferrets Saugus.net page`_
or `The Gateway of the Ferrets itch.io page`_.

What Is It About?
-----------------

In this short game you take on the role of someone trapped in a dead end with
a complicated mechanism providing the only way out. Fortunately you're not
all alone: there is a pair of friendly ferrets who can help you!

A big part of this game is interacting with the two ferrets, Cinnamon and
Sugar. While there's no dog in this game, it's certainly possible to pat the
ferrets!

Status
------

This game is fully playable and winnable and should hopefully be reasonably
bug-free (please let me know if you find any issues and I'll add your name
to the play testers credits when I fix them).
